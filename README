BAT - Bugzilla Advanced TreeView
================================

BAT looks like Bugzilla's 'showdependencytree.cgi' page with added functionality:
The extension gives you a tree view of dependencies and blockers of a given set of bugs.

BAT's features:
 - show multiple trees
 - allow changing dependencies, drag and drop
 - allow creating more dependencies, ctrl + drag and drop
 - link to create a bug 'under any given bug' in the tree
   - with product & component + selected attributes inherited
 - link to clone 'any given bug' in the tree
   - same as above
   - with depencies & blocking inherited



CONFIGURATION:
================================

Install BAT directory under <bugzilla directory>/extensions/BAT

patch your bugzilla with:
cd <bugzilla directory>
patch < <where BAT is>/new_hooks.patch
